# About the author

My name is [Ken Hansen](http://kenhansen01.github.io.com), I am a father, husband, baker, friend of the earth and fighter for justice. I am also a SharePoint Architect working at [Byrne Software](http://www.byrnesoftware.com/).

I work with a variety of software stacks and a lot of what you might see will have a SharePoint flavor. If you are interested in more of my contributions to the open source community, have a look at [my repositories](https://github.com/kenhansen01?tab=repositories).
