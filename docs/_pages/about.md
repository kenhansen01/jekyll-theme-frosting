Oh hi!

Nice that you decided to stop by. I'm a father of a wonderful child, spouse to an amazing woman, planet loving tree-hugger, and a fighter for justice. My job is that of a SharePoint Architect. :smile:.

<!-- {% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" caption="Examples of included layouts `splash`, `single`, and `archive`." %} -->

## About the site
So, I have learned a lot from the developers out there that put their hard work up for all to see and use. I wouldn't be where I am without their generous help. This is all about paying it forward.

A lot of what you will find here is SharePoint centric. Sometimes even very specific to whatever job I had when I made the repo. But there are other fun things too. I will add more when I have time.
